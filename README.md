# Antenna-Pattern
Antenna Pattern is a JavaScript based Antenna Radiation Pattern plotter. Researchers in communication may find it useful. however this is in pre-alpha stage. So many bugs are present and the scope of this project is very much limited currently. Developers are free to improve this.  USAGE: just open Antena.html and plot the pattern you wish.  Currently only independent variable supported is 'x' that corresponds to angle in degrees. So you can play around f(x).
